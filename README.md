Meeting Minutes Plugin for Small Councils and organizations

This plugin is a simple WordPress plugin that allows admin users to add Meeting information. It is targeted to small councils and organizations who are required to publish their meeting information and let the public have access to it.

The basic functionality is:

Allow an admin to:
* Write the name of the meeting (post title)
* Enter the date of the meeting
* Upload a pdf for the meeting agenda
* Upload a pdf for the meeting minutes
* Write a summary of the meeting

All this information is shown for each meeting on a page or post by using the shortcode [show-meetings].

The information is shown in a particular format, and is sorted by publish date. (is it - or by meeting date?)
